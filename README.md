## 🌌 Overview

**Retinal AI** is a deep learning–based system designed to detect and classify **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** severity from retinal fundus images.  
It uses **ResNet-based CNN models (PyTorch)** and a **modern Tkinter GUI** with a dark gradient theme for a professional hospital interface.

The system allows clinicians and users to upload retinal images, get real-time DR predictions, view reports, and access verified ophthalmologists across **Tamil Nadu**.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

> Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of preventable blindness in adults.

- Manual diagnosis requires trained ophthalmologists and is time-consuming.  
- Lack of experts in rural areas delays detection and treatment.  
- AI-based screening systems can reduce diagnostic load and save vision early.

---

## 🚀 Motivation

In Tamil Nadu and similar regions, early detection of DR can prevent permanent blindness.  
**Retinal AI** supports medical professionals by providing fast, reliable, and automated DR detection.

Inspired by institutions like:
- 🏥 **Aravind Eye Hospital (Madurai)**
- 🌐 **APTOS (Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society)**  

These organizations aim to democratize eye care through innovation.

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview

A **ResNet-based CNN** model (trained on APTOS 2019 dataset) predicts DR severity from 0–4:

| Label | Condition |
|:------:|:-----------|
| 0 | 🟢 No DR |
| 1 | 🟡 Mild |
| 2 | 🟠 Moderate |
| 3 | 🔴 Severe |
| 4 | ⚫ Proliferative DR |

Users can log in, upload retinal images, get a diagnostic prediction, and contact nearby ophthalmologists for follow-up.
